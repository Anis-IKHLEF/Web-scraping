Yallakora Match Data Scraping Project
This project scrapes football match data from the Yallakora website for a user-specified date. Using Python, Requests, and BeautifulSoup, it extracts match details such as teams, scores, and match times, then structures the data for further analysis or storage. The project demonstrates web scraping, HTML parsing, and basic data handling skills.
